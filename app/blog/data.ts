We explore how we built a consensus model in Telegram that never drafts or triggers actions without your permission.\n\nAutonomous agents are powerful, but when they operate directly on your email, customer accounts, or payment gateways, mistake costs are high. The Consent Loop is our answer. Rather than letting the AI execute blindly, elpino constructs drafts, proposes actions, and sends a single, interactive Telegram prompt. With a simple tap on 'Approve' or 'Reject', you maintain complete control without ever having to log into a heavy administration panel.",

The LLM agent receives only localized context and does not have access to the credentials. When a tool call is generated, it is validated in an isolated execution sandbox that merges the decrypted token, processes the API request, and immediately wipes the keys from active memory.",
