        <p>
          Elpino connects to inboxes, calendars, and payment data — security isn&apos;t optional
          for us. If you&apos;ve found a vulnerability, we genuinely want to hear about it, and
          we&apos;ll work with you to fix it fast. This page explains how to report, what&apos;s
          in scope, and what you can expect from us in return.
